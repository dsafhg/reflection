When to commit?
One commit per logical change

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a .git file which tracks the changes in files in the directory. Nothing is commited 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is intermediate step before commit. You can place a couple of file in the staging area and commit them at once
